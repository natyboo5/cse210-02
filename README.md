How did you apply abstraction in your program’s design?

In python when we talk about abstraction, we are talking about classes, in the design of our Hilo program we created 2 classes.

The first class has an object call Dealer.
     •	The responsibility of this class is to control the sequence of the play.

The second class has an object call Card.
    •	The responsibility of this class is displaying the cards, one at a time. 
    •	There is one behavior or function “drawn ()” that will use one variable “card_number”, this function will generate the random number of the card.
